      We lost a very shy, indoor-outdoor cat when we moved about 10 days ago...
      We've tried to do a house-to-house search of the area but many neighbors have politely refused
      to help. When I finally got around to posting an ad, and offering a reward on your website, I
      got my kitty back within two hours of posting it! I'm so glad I signed up and got Puffs back.
      Please keep doing the wonderful work you do.<br /> -Johanna
